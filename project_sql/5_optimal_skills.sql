and a high-paying skills)?
-Identify skills in high demand and associated with high average salaries for Data Engineer roles
-Concentrates on remote positions with specified salaries
-Why? Targets skills that offer job security (high demand) and financial benefits (high salaries),
    offering strategic insights for career development in data engineering.
